# Coffee Automation System

This project contains a Java application to manage the basic functions of a coffee shop business. The application handles customer orders, updates inventory, processes coffee sales, and manages customer balances.

## Features
- **Coffee Menu**: Customers can choose from a variety of coffee types (Mocha, Latte, Cappuccino, Macchiato) and sizes (Tall, Grande, Venti). Each type and size has a specific price.
- **Order Processing**: The system checks if the requested coffee is in stock, processes the order, and updates the inventory and sales records.
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks the quantity of each coffee type and automatically updates stock levels after each sale.
- **Payment Management**: Verifies if the customer has sufficient balance in their wallet to complete the purchase.
- **Sales and Inventory Reports**: The system can display total sales and current inventory status.
